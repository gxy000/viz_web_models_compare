    &quot;To determine the original price of the Serta Radford 11&#x27; Twin Plush Tight Top Mattress before the sale, we need to analyze the information provided in the image.\n\n1. The image shows a mattress with a sale price of $292.12.\n2. The image also mentions an 11% rebate.\n3. The price after the rebate is $259.99.\n\nTo find the original price before the sale, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Let the original price be \\( P \\).\n2. The sale price is $292.12.\n3. The rebate is 11% of the original price, which is \\( 0.11P \\).\n\nThe price after the rebate is given by:\n\\[ P - 0.11P = 259.99 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 0.89P = 259.99 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = \\frac{259.99}{0.89} \\]\n\\[ P \\approx 325.83 \\]\n\nThe original price of the mattress before the sale is approximately $325.83.\n\nThe answer is $325.83&quot;
